Today is our second month together, *October 4th* is a day that stays in my mind.

I hope we make stay forever.

*Math's exam was incredibly easy*, though you could not say it was an easy exam, I somehow activated all my braincells and managed to perform pretty well. That was my impression at least, I'll have to wait to get marked.
