Today is our **second month together together**, **October 4th*
*is a day that stays in my mind.

**_I hope we make stay forever.
I love her more than words can say nor I could convey_

**Math's exam was incredibly easy***, though you could not say it was an easy exam, I somehow activated all my braincells and managed to perform pretty well. That was my impression at least, I'll have to wait to get marked.

__*I KICKED OUT A KID*__.   I had nothing to do at the library, that's what comes after exam week. Today was by far the most exhausting day I've ever had in matters of working.

Some kids were arguing and hitting each other. Teasing, disrespect and swearwords were all over the place. 
**I got mad and yelled at them** . I'm proud I encouraged enough to face them, I'm always passive and this proved I indeed deserve my job.
