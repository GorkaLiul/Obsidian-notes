# Journey  (morning)
---

I woke up 3 times, wanted to be productive from the start of the morning but its clear I'm a bum. I woke up once at 10:00, slept back until the second alarm rang at 10:30 and somehow fell asleep while trying to get up. I finally woke up at 11:43. 

Though I woke up late and wasted the whole morning by the time I woke up, I managed to put some order into my day. After waking up, I minimized the use of my phone, I ate  cereals for breakfast  (I was too lazy to make pancakes). I watched modern family while eating but the antena signal started to wane so I cleaned everything up and went to the bathroom, washed my face and teeth exhaustively ( #thao 's mother is a Dentist).

Now I'm gonna continue with my To-do app project. I'll first arrange what I have to do and I'll try to finish those steps one by one.
