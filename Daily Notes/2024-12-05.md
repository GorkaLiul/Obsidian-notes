# #journey 

Today morning I woke up at 6:30, thought I deserved the sleep to deactivate the 6:00 alarm. **_i almost overslept** 

#Thao Is being a little bit distant since yesterday, I don't really know why but since my rental bike broke she has kept the distance.

I feel I said something wrong but she won't tell me what. She keeps on telling me everything is OK. 

I feel it's nothing too bad or some problem of her's but I don't want her to overthink over me, I know she's sensitive and emotional and really distances herself when she's not feeling well.
# Bridge weekend 

*Thursday night*, we're on discord call, I wanted to code but talking with her is way better, we have been talking since I started coding, but got me completely distracted. 

Today's activity: __*Karaoke date*__ It was amazing for sure. I enjoyed it so much she got me absorbed, I lost notion of time and wasn't very productive let's say but I can't express how this was no problem at all. 

I managed to __*sync my phone and laptop for obsidian*__  through #Github and the __*fit sync*__ plugin. It works amazingly and I can keep notion of where I commit changes from and keep notion of my past notes with __*git timeline*__. Repo at:
