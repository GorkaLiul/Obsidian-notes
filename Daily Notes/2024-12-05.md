# #journey 

Today morning I woke up at 6:30, thought I deserved the sleep to deactivate the 6:00 alarm. **_i almost overslept** 

#Thao Is being a little bit distant since yesterday, I don't really know why but since my rental bike broke she has kept the distance. 

I feel I said something wrong but she won't tell me what. She keeps on telling me everything is OK. 

I feel it's nothing too bad or some problem of her's but I don't want her to overthink over me, I know she's sensitive and emotional and really distances herself when she's not feeling well.
