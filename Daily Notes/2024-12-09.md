# journey after school 


It's 17:49, today was awful and great too. First of all my grades never looked worse, here's an attachment to my exams. [[Exams]]
Long story short I have a 6,5 mean, max mean grade was 7,5 so far and worst grade in Language with 4,8

I believe I could have done so much better if I had started organizing myself before. 
I decide to apply my own chaos based mind deficit term and therefore I can blindly trust that I'll do better in the recovery exams. __im not satisfied with my grades and I won't be untill I see everything +8__

# #Thao 's audition

- A part from that #Thao invited me to go to her auditions, she'll be the presenter of the event and I'm more than happy she offered me to be her companion. 

- I'm so excited about it and I can't wait to see her up on stage and chat with her parents too. Specialty her mother.
