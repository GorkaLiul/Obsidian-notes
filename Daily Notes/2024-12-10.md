# Journey (morning)

I woke up at 07:01, I missed the 6 am six alarm and the ones between 6 am and 7 am. It's raining outside, in tired. 
I either missed th alarms because my phone was not right besides me or because of ***the pain of being kicked in the nutsack from yesterday.***

# #Thao s mother likes me

Thao texted me saying her mother talked about how she doesn't hate me at all but even likes me. Apparently she affirmed I have good looking eyes and sweet expressions, that's something Im really excited about, I really want to be closer to her and her family. I love Thao so much HHhH😭❤️🦖💫🦐
