# Journey (morning)

I woke up at 4,37, I don't know why ***I was feeling dizzy and asked unax to play Valorant*** 

I slept again and woke up at 7:02, a bit late, then I got ready. It was 07:21 by the time I was leaving the hall so I had tu run to the bus. I got there just as the bus came in.

I have a slight headache but it's better now that #Thao asked me about it, it should have nothing to do but I feel much better now.
#Thao and I slept on call, sadly around 02:00 more or less, I accidentally hung up on her so I couldn't see her pretty face in the morning

# Journey (Afterclass)

I have finished my classes, nothign very interesting happened though. 

***I managed to uninstall Lazarus***  the laptop blocker to track our activities. I also got marked on some grades. I marked a solid 6,75 on Philosophy, I'm not proud of it at all as the mark turned out to be best for good writers and not very philosophy prone. Because of this I'm taking a new approach on my recovery exam as ==***I can do so much more with so little boilerplate***== 

I received some more means which are listed at [[General]]. 
Long story short, I hace a 7.5 mean for Philosophy and 9.5 for Scientific Culture among many other marks but I'll have cranked them up by next January.
