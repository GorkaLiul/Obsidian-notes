# Journey (morning)

I woke up at 4,37, I don't know why ***I was feeling dizzy and asked unax to play Valorant*** 

I slept again and woke up at 7:02, a bit late, then I got ready. It was 07:21 by the time I was leaving the hall so I had tu run to the bus. I got there just as the bus came in.

I have a slight headache but it's better now that #Thao asked me about it, it should have nothing to do but I feel much better now.
#Thao and I slept on call, sadly around 02:00 more or less, I accidentally hung up on her so I couldn't see her pretty face in the morning
