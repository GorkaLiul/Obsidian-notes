# Journey  (morning)
---

I woke up 3 times, wanted to be productive from the start of the morning but its clear I'm a bum. I woke up once at 10:00, slept back until the second alarm rang at 10:30 and somehow fell asleep while trying to get up. I finally woke up at 11:43. 

Though I woke up late and wasted the whole morning by the time I woke up, I managed to put some order into my day. After waking up, I minimized the use of my phone, I ate breakfast ()
