My ankle hurts a lot

I have my technical drawing test and I don't feel ready at all
I couldn't study for Spanish exam because I was drawing 
I woke up on sleep call with #Thao ❤️

Life is better since her.

# A posteriori 

I'm doomed,  today's exams were terrible too. I think I'll have to go redo my exams after Christmas, sadly I won't get any better than 8.
