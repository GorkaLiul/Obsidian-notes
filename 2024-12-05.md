Today morning I woke up at 6:30, thought I deserved the sleep to deactivate the 6:00 alarm. **_i almost overslept** 

#Thao Is being a little bit distant since yesterday, I don't really know why but since my rental bike broke she has kept the distance. 
I feel I said something wrong but she won't tell me what,
